This secured chat app is also a secured notes app. 

you enter your notes with your name (unique - one entry per name in the database)
with a given 16-characters key you enter a chat layout that shows previous messages (notes) with the date they were sent.
you can use multiple keys for the messages when you enter from the login page. 

each message can be decyphered only with the identical key that was given for the message in the first place. 

all of the message contents are stored and secured with Firebase.
First in the video we see a new entry with a never used before name. we use a key to encrypt a few messages.
afterwards we enter with the same name so we could see the previous messages.
